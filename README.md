# 1-sie-**Knowledge Base**

The **Knowledge Base** serves as the repository for all data and information pertinent to the project, encompassing not just numerical data, but also textual content such as literature reviews, notes, and summaries. Designed for ease of access and reproducibility, this component is organized in the form of datasets, drawing inspiration from the concept of data packages.

**Key Features:**

- **Comprehensive Data Storage:** The Knowledge Base houses diverse data types, from numbers to textual information, ensuring that any content that can be structured into a spreadsheet finds a place here.

- **Dataset Structure:** Each dataset within the Knowledge Base is meticulously curated and includes, at a minimum:
    - **Metadata or Read-Me File:** A descriptive text file providing context and details about the dataset.
    - **Data Wrangling Script:** A well-commented script designed to preprocess and manipulate raw data, making it suitable for analysis.

- **Convenience and Customization:** Users have the flexibility to create additional folders within the Knowledge Base to suit their organizational needs.

- **Data-Analysis Separation:** Adhering to the principle of keeping data distinct from analyses, the Knowledge Base ensures that the original data remains unaltered and readily available, safeguarding against inadvertent errors during analysis.

**Leveraging R Projects:**

A central strategy for creating datasets involves the use of R projects. While the principles we discuss are applicable across different programming languages, we assume that our audience is familiar with coding in R using R Studio, and hence, our examples will be presented accordingly.

**What are R Projects?**
R projects are an integral feature of R Studio that facilitates the organization and management of your work. They provide a structured environment that stores your code, data, and other files in a dedicated directory. This ensures that paths are set correctly and consistently, making your work more reproducible and shareable.

**Why are R Projects Helpful?**
R projects are instrumental in maintaining an organized workflow. By encapsulating all necessary components within a single, unified environment, they simplify project management and enhance collaboration. Users can easily switch between different projects, ensuring that the workspace, history, and file paths are automatically aligned to the selected project.

**Importance of Separation:** By maintaining this separation, researchers can confidently experiment with their analyses, knowing that should any errors occur—such as unintentional column replacements—the original data remains untouched and ready for retrieval from the Knowledge Base.
