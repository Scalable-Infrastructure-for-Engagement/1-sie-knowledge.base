Containers are standalone lightweight packages of the original model software and their dependencies that can be run independent of the platform. As such they are suitable for reuse and sharing results. However, the use of containers is rare in the field of modeling social-environmental systems.

Despite increasing efforts to encourage data sharing, both the quality of shared data and the frequency of data reuse remain stubbornly low. We argue here that a significant reason for this unfortunate state of affairs is that the organization of research results in the findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) form required for reuse is too often deferred to the end of a research project when preparing publications–by which time essential details are no longer accessible. Thus, we propose an approach to research informatics in which FAIR principles are applied continuously, from the inception of a research project and ubiquitously, to every data asset produced by experiment or computation. We suggest that this seemingly challenging task can be made feasible by the adoption of simple tools, such as lightweight identifiers (to ensure that every data asset is findable), packaging methods (to facilitate understanding of data contents), data access methods, and metadata organization and structuring tools (to support schema development and evolution). We use an example from experimental neuroscience to illustrate how these methods can work in practice., Imagine that you are presented with a crowded attic full of boxes of family photos and asked to assemble an accurate photographic record of some relative’s life. Most would find such a task extremely difficult. Researchers face similar challenges when attempting to comply with the data-sharing mandates that funding agencies and journals are increasingly enforcing. As they prepare a publication, they seek to assemble the data on which their results are based, but often find that these data are hard to identify, being distributed over different storage systems and labeled in ways that made sense when data was saved, but that convey little information today. Thus the data that they ultimately share are often incomplete or even inaccurate. As scientific progress depends on the ability to reproduce published research results, this situation is more than unfortunate. We suggest that this gap between intent and action is due primarily to poor process, not bad intentions, and in particular because data sharing concerns are often considered only at the end of an investigation when a publication is being prepared. We argue that the key to improved research data sharing is to adopt processes that make all data involved in a research project, in all phases, findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (or FAIR, in contemporary parlance). We suggest further that, just as digital cameras can simplify the family historian’s life by automatically recording a time and place for every photo, so can good tools simplify the adoption of the processes required to achieve such continuous and ubiquitous FAIRness. We use an example from a multi-year neuroscience investigation to illustrate how suitable methods and tools can result in not only better data sharing at the time of publication but also greater efficiency and effectiveness in the work of the research team over the course of a project.","2022","2023-05-09 06:21:42","2023-05-09 06:21:42","2023-05-09 06:21:42","10.1162/99608f92.44d21b86","","3","4","","Harv Data Sci Rev","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 36035065 PMCID: PMC9410569","","/Users/guerrero-fj/Zotero/storage/UY8WDQZS/Dempsey et al. - 2022 - Sharing Begins at Home.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9410569/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In support of this approach, we present a set of rules to help researchers write understandable Dockerfiles for typical data science workflows.

We introduce these terms with illustrative examples from hydrology using a hydrologic modelling framework along with cyberinfrastructure aimed at fostering reproducibility. Using this taxonomy as a guide, we argue that containerization is an important but lacking component needed to achieve the goal of computational reproducibility in hydrology and environmental modelling.

Computational notebooks are files that contain descriptive text, as well as code and its outputs, in a single, dynamic, and visually appealing file that is easier to understand by nonspecialists. Traditionally used by data scientists when producing reports and informing decision-making, the use of this tool in research publication is not common, despite its potential to increase research impact and quality. For a single study, the content of such documentation partially overlaps with that of classical lab notebooks and that of the scientific manuscript reporting the study. Therefore, to minimize the amount of work required to manage all the files related to these contents and optimize their production, we present a starter kit to facilitate the implementation of computational notebooks in the research process, including publication. The kit contains the template of a computational notebook integrated into a research project that employs R, Python, or Julia. Using examples of ecological studies, we show how computational notebooks also foster the implementation of principles of Open Science, such as reproducibility and traceability. The kit is designed for beginners, but at the end we present practices that can be gradually implemented to develop a fully digital research workflow.

Here, we argue that coding skills honed for peer communication can be leveraged to overcome these challenges within a “coding for broader impact” framework that provides tasks to promote effective communication and culminates in individualized stakeholder reports. The reports explicitly incorporate stakeholder knowledge and are coded in conjunction with tasks for peer communication. We illustrate the framework through three case studies in which we shared data and information about backyard biodiversity, agricultural impacts, and tick-borne disease with homeowners, farmers, and land managers.

Despite these benefits, the use of GitHub in ecology and evolution is not widespread. To help researchers in ecology and evolution adopt useful features from GitHub to improve their research workflows, we review 12 practical ways to use the platform. We outline features ranging from low to high technical difficulty, including storing code, managing projects, coding collaboratively, conducting peer review, writing a manuscript, and using automated and continuous integration to streamline analyses. Given that members of a research team may have different technical skills and responsibilities, we describe how the optimal use of GitHub features may vary among members of a research collaboration.

Central to this framework is the concept of a ""reproducible analytical pipeline"" (RAP). Two primary approaches to creating a RAP are discussed: involving a dedicated team member responsible for converting complex code into a reproducible pipeline or individual adoption of reproducibility practices, challenging the common misconception that prioritizing reproducibility consumes excessive time. The study demonstrates that the proposed techniques do not significantly extend analysis time and, in fact, seamlessly integrate into the analytical process, enhancing project management, reducing revision needs, and mitigating challenges through testing. It highlights the recurring nature of data analysis, where even seemingly simple tasks evolve, emphasizing the need for consistency and completeness in preserving scripts. A practical example illustrates the importance of a reproducible pipeline in gathering data from diverse sources. The study underscores proactive communication with stakeholders as a critical factor when initiating a reproducible analytical pipeline, streamlining data acquisition and processing and facilitating reproducibility from project inception.","2023-10-03","2023-04-26 23:12:46","2023-10-31 18:50:56","2023-04-26 23:12:46","","","","","","","Reproducible pipelines","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","/Users/guerrero-fj/Zotero/storage/UPBLT7L2/preface.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there is rapid evolution in scholarly communication. Usage is moving to electronic formats. In some areas, it appears that electronic versions of papers are being read about as often as the printed journal versions. Although there are serious difficulties in comparing figures from different media, the growth rates in usage of electronic scholarly information are sufficiently high that if they continue for a few years, there will be no doubt that print versions will be eclipsed. Further, much of the electronic information that is accessed is outside the formal scholarly publication process. There is also vigorous growth in forms of electronic communication that take advantage of the unique capabilities of the web, and which simply do not fit into the traditional journal publishing format. This paper presents some statistics on usage of print and electronic information. It also discusses some preliminary evidence about the changing patterns of usage. It appears that much of the online usage comes from new readers (esoteric research papers assigned in undergraduate classes, for example) and often from places that do not have access to print journals. Also, the reactions to even slight barriers to usage suggest that even high-quality scholarly papers are not irreplaceable. Readers are faced with a ‘river of knowledge’ that allows them to select among a multitude of sources, and to find near substitutes when necessary. To stay relevant, scholars, publishers and librarians will have to make even greater efforts to make their material easily accessible.","2002","2023-04-26 23:09:09","2023-04-26 23:09:09","2023-04-26 23:09:09","7-19","","1","15","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1087/095315102753303634","","/Users/guerrero-fj/Zotero/storage/VIMBVZDX/Odlyzko - 2002 - The rapid evolution of scholarly communication.pdf; /Users/guerrero-fj/Zotero/storage/QAH9DAZJ/095315102753303634.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this Perspective, we review an array of explicit and implicit definitions of reproducibility and related terminology, and discuss how to avoid potential misunderstandings when these terms are used as a surrogate for “truth.” Concern about the reproducibility of scientific research has been steadily rising recently with reports that the results of experiments in numerous domains of science could not be replicated (1, 2). Whereas problems in biomedical research have garnered most of the attention, concerns have touched almost every field in the biological and social sciences and beyond (3) (Fig. 1). As the movement to examine and enhance the reliability of research expands, it is important to note that some of its basic terms—reproducibility, replicability, reliability, robustness, and generalizabilityare not standardized. This diverse nomenclature has led to confusion, both conceptual and operational, about what kind of confirmation is needed to trust a given scientific result. Here, we dissect this vocabulary, explore the reasons for the confusion, and offer a framework to improve both communication and understanding.","2016-06","2023-04-26 23:03:36","2023-10-31 18:30:04","2023-04-26 23:03:36","","","341","8","","Sci.

This integration allows readers to both verify and adapt the statements in the documents. Authors can easily reproduce them in the future, and they can present the document’s contents in a different medium, e.g. with interactive controls. This paper describes a software framework for authoring and distributing these integrated, dynamic documents that contain text, code, data, and any auxiliary content needed to recreate the computations. The documents are dynamic in that the contents, including figures, tables, etc., can be recalculated each time a view of the document is generated. Our model treats a dynamic document as a master or “source” document from which one can generate different views in the form of traditional, derived documents for different audiences. We introduce the concept of a compendium as both a container for the different elements that make up the document and its computations (i.e. text, code, data, ...), and as a means for distributing, managing and updating the collection. The step from disseminating analyses via a compendium to reproducible research is a small one. By reproducible research, we mean research papers with accompanying software tools that allow the reader to directly reproduce the results and employ the methods that are presented in the research paper. Some of the issues involved in paradigms for the production, distribution and use of such reproducible research are discussed.","2007-03","2023-04-26 23:03:36","2023-10-31 18:28:47","2023-04-26 23:03:36","1-23","","1","16","","Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/guerrero-fj/Zotero/storage/FSVHMHDJ/Gentleman and Temple Lang - 2007 - Statistical Analyses and Reproducible Research.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, I explore common reasons that code developed for one research project cannot be successfully executed or extended by subsequent researchers. I review current approaches to these issues, including virtual machines and workflow systems, and their limitations. I then examine how the popular emerging technology Docker combines several areas from systems research - such as operating system virtualization, cross-platform portability, modular re-usable elements, versioning, and a 'DevOps' philosophy, to address these challenges.

Therefore we first study fundamentals and existing approaches. On that basis, our key contributions are the identification of core requirements of authors, readers, publishers, curators, as well as preservationists and the subsequent description of an executable research compendium (ERC). It is the main component of a publication process providing a new way to publish and access computational research. ERCs provide a new standardisable packaging mechanism which combines data, software, text, and a user interface description.

It is argued that while new knowledge is developed by individuals, organizations play a critical role in articulating and amplifying that knowledge. A theoretical framework is developed which provides an analytical perspective on the constituent dimensions of knowledge creation.

More specifically, we share an organized framework for understanding the TPG and suggest recommendations that can help make progress in one or more dimension(s). Conceptual topics discussed are the implications of the gap and its persistence. Organizational/institutional topics include the implications of the overabundance, inaccessibility, and uncertainty of scientific information, and a need for mainstreaming boundary spanning activities. Lastly, cultural topics include differences in culture and epistemologies across knowledge generators and users, shifting cultures through co-production, and changes in educational curricula. Recommendations for minimizing the TPG include conceptually recasting what is considered ‘success,’ institutional reform, enhanced information delivery, leveraging knowledge brokers and boundary organizations, leveraging ‘champions’ in policy, using co-production and/or integrative research, confronting the contemporary ‘fake news’ phenomenon, and rethinking researcher and practitioner training and development.

Among the diverse and complex reasons for this gap, three barriers are fundamental: knowledge is often unavailable to practitioners and challenging to interpret or difficult to use or both. Problems of availability, interpretability, and useability are solvable with open science practices. We considered the benefits and challenges of three open science practices for use by conservation scientists and practitioners. First, open access publishing makes the scientific literature available to all. Second, open materials (detailed methods, data, code, and software) increase the transparency and use of research findings. Third, open education resources allow conservation scientists and practitioners to acquire the skills needed to use research outputs. The long-term adoption of open science practices would help researchers and practitioners achieve conservation goals more quickly and efficiently and reduce inequities in information sharing. However, short-term costs for individual researchers (insufficient institutional incentives to engage in open science and knowledge mobilization) remain a challenge. We caution against a passive approach to sharing that simply involves making information available.

This qualitative study is set in the context of Indonesia, in which two cases are examined: creative apparel entrepreneurs in Bandung and batik producers in Surakarta. The results show that regional environments provide opportunities for creative industries to find specialist suppliers, to gather market information and, importantly, to find and cross-fertilise new ideas. Although regions provide these opportunities, the firms’ internal social capital is crucial in being able to internalise and transform the knowledge from the environment into innovative values embodied in their products.","2019","2023-07-17 16:35:41","2023-07-17 16:35:41","2023-07-17 16:35:41","370-385","","3","60","","","Business networks, social capital and the economic performance of creative and cultural industries","","","","","","","en","© 2019 Victoria University of Wellington and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/apv.12211","","/Users/guerrero-fj/Zotero/storage/CBFU7JGE/apv.html","","","networks; creative industries; Indonesia; regional development; social capital","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet the factors that affect long-run social capital formation remain poorly understood. Recent evidence suggests that early state formation, especially investments in state capacity, are positively associated with higher levels of contemporary social capital and other prosocial attitudes. The channels by which early state capacity leads to greater social capital over time are even less understood. We contribute to both questions using the spatial and temporal expansion of the US postal network during the 19th century. We first show that county-level variation in post office density is highly correlated with a bevy of historical and contemporary indicators of social capital (e.g., associational memberships, civic participation, health, and crime). This finding holds even when controlling for historical measures of development and contemporary measures of income, inequality, poverty, education, and race. Second, we provide evidence of an informational mechanism by which this early investment in infrastructural capacity affected long-run social capital formation. Namely, we demonstrate that the expansion of the postal network in the 19th century strongly predicts the historical and contemporary location of local newspapers, which were the primary mode of impersonal information transmission during this period. Our evidence sheds light on the role of the state in both the origins of social capital and the channels by which it persists. Our findings also suggest that the consequences of the ongoing decline in local newspapers will negatively affect social capital.","2020-05-19","2023-07-17 16:34:55","2023-07-17 16:34:55","2023-07-17 16:34:55","10755-10761","","20","117","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","pnas.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","","/Users/guerrero-fj/Zotero/storage/FT39TJ5C/Jensen and Ramey - 2020 - Early investments in state capacity promote persis.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The paper illustrates how social capital influences innovation in science and technology by examining the network structure of the biotechnology industry in the United States and the regionally-based industrial system in Silicon Valley, California. The increasing relevance of network development is highlighted through two U.S. national policy programs: the Advanced Technology Program and the Manufacturing Extension Partnership. The paper provides a series of recommendations aimed at boosting innovative capacity through the cultivation of social capital. The core arguments concerning the relationship between social capital and innovation are applicable beyond national boundaries, and many of the policy recommendations are pertinent for Western European, some East Asian, and several other industrialized states.","1998-04","2023-07-17 16:31:10","2023-11-01 01:08:24","2023-07-17 16:31:10","","","","","","","Social capital","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/guerrero-fj/Zotero/storage/RIQ7B5AR/1998 - Social capital Its relationship to innovation in .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Context-dependent properties are not activated by the respective word independent of context. Rather, these properties are activated only by relevant contexts in which the word appears. Context-independent properties form the core meanings of words, whereas context-dependent properties are a source of semantic encoding variability. This proposal lies between two opposing theories of meaning, one that argues all properties of a concept are active on all occasions and another that argues the active properties are completely determined by context. The existence of context-independent and context-dependent properties is demonstrated in two experimental settings: the property-verification task and judgments of similarity.

When someone knows a mathematical fact, we say that she knows 'with mathematical certainty,' and it is commonly assumed that nothing can be more firmly grounded than that. Not surprisingly, in philosophical contexts, mathematics is often used as an epistemological role model. Mathematical knowledge is assumed to be absolute and undeniably firm. The main reason for that special status lies in the fact that mathematicians prove their theorems: Mathematical knowledge is proven knowledge. What has been proven is established beyond all doubt. Thus, mathematical knowledge stands out as a uniform, privileged form of knowledge. Or so it would seem. The main thesis of our paper is that, like other forms of knowledge, mathematical knowledge needs to be understood in a context-dependent way. Whether a given epistemic subject knows that P (for some mathematical proposition P) depends on specific requirements set by context. These requirements will be linked to a context-dependent notion of proof and to the subject's mathematical skills.","2008","2023-07-17 16:21:29","2023-11-01 01:05:47","2023-07-17 16:21:29","91-107","","1","76","","Grazer Philos Stud","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/guerrero-fj/Zotero/storage/5ILMN8L7/Löwe and Müller - 2008 - MATHEMATICAL KNOWLEDGE IS CONTEXT DEPENDENT.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A corollary of this thesis is that knowledge takes on form and content from the situation in which it is enacted, i.e. that it is situated and context-dependent. I argue this point at some length in Article 5 where I corroborate the theoretical Wittgensteinian-cum-phenomenological analysis with empirical evidence supplied by research within the fields of distributed cognition (Hutchins, 1993; Hutchins & Klausen, 1996) and situated learning theory (Lave, 1988; Lave & Wenger, 1991; Nielsen & Kvale, 2003; Wenger, 1998). Further examples are discussed in Articles 3, 7 and 10, dealing, respectively, with student understanding of physics and philosophy aspects of quantum mechanics; with the ‘knowledge and skills’ required in the PISA surveys; and with the competence demands placed on students when the user-generated, dynamic practices of Web 2.0 are introduced as learning activities within education. In Articles 7 and 10, my argument centers on the way requirement characteristics at the activity-framing context level delimit and to some extent determine (or create tensions concerning) what in the given situation will count as an appropriate way to let the requirement characteristics at the activity-internal context level frame the ones at the domain-internal level. My discussion of the example in Article 3, conversely, focuses on the domain-internal level, more particularly on the different domain-internal requirement characteristics of physics and philosophy which result in different answers to questions of relevance and significance – even of truth – concerning specific statements about quantum mechanics. In all three articles the point is that any given situation poses a certain complex of demands on the person acting in it and that acting knowledgeably precisely is to let one’s actions be formed and given content by this complex of demands.","2017-09-21","2023-07-17 16:14:24","2023-10-31 18:47:37","2023-07-17 16:14:24","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Southern Denmark","Denmark","en-US","","","","","","","","","/Users/guerrero-fj/Zotero/storage/IYLHTR9A/knowledge-as-situated-and-context-dependent.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","First","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, a key dimension that is less well understood is the importance of social capital and the role it plays in enabling communities to respond. This research aims to address this gap through a case study with two semi-coastal communities in Mexico that have being hit by hurricanes recently. Structured and semi-structured interviews were carried out to collect data, which was analyzed through an interpretive approach. Network analysis was also carried out to explain the role of the different actors in the response to disturbances as hurricanes and the possible relationship with social capital. Results showed that social capital is relevant for coping with hurricanes; although bonding relationships were acknowledged as the most relevant for supporting when these events occur; linking relationships were also recognized as fundamental, particularly for responses on the long term (productive diversification, improvements in infrastructure). These findings are useful for designing better-fitted schemes towards adaptation, as one of the communities showed more vulnerability due to an absence of links with external actors. Also, it demonstrates that climate change research with different approaches, such as network analysis, is fundamental to get more in-depth data to design context specific strategies to cope with disasters associated to this phenomenon.","2021-01-01","2023-07-17 16:11:36","2023-07-17 16:11:36","2023-07-17 16:11:36","101951","","","52","","International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction","How does social capital shape the response to environmental disturbances at the local level?","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/guerrero-fj/Zotero/storage/9PB4BUIS/S2212420920314539.html","","","Hurricanes; Network analysis; Adaptation; Disasters; Social capital","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Simultaneously, early-career researchers in water resources face a shifting professional landscape in which academic career paths are sparse but where versatile skill sets relevant to water resources issues in governments, non-governmental organizations, and the private sector are in high demand. Here, we describe an adaptable fellowship model that has proven to be a “win-win-win” for early-career researchers, government agencies, and universities tackling wicked water resources challenges in Wisconsin, USA. The fellowship program recruits post-masters and post-doctoral fellows to lead research on a water resources challenge identified as a high priority by a government agency partner. Fellows receive mentorship from both academic and agency mentors and co-produce actionable knowledge. Costs and administrative responsibilities are shared by the university (Sea Grant/Water Resources Institute) and the host agency. Since its inception in 2015, this program has trained 24 fellows across 11 host programs on issues that range from highly quantitative water quality and hydrogeological questions to qualitative assessments of fisheries management and coastal hazards. In this arrangement, fellows receive collaborative and cross-disciplinary training that prepares them well for diverse career paths, government agencies benefit from new knowledge targeted at pressing water resources management questions, and university institutions accomplish their missions of training researchers and developing actionable knowledge. We describe this model's applicability to other regions and institutions. Ultimately, this type of program benefits society by building long-term capacity for collaboration which addresses wicked water problems.","2021","2023-07-17 16:10:36","2023-07-17 16:10:36","2023-07-17 16:10:36","139-154","","1","174","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1936-704X.2021.3365.x","","/Users/guerrero-fj/Zotero/storage/QM5MWQVB/j.1936-704X.2021.3365.html; /Users/guerrero-fj/Zotero/storage/44LKR9EY/Voter et al. - 2021 - Adaptable University-Agency Early-Career Fellowshi.pdf","","","professional development; actionable science; wicked water problems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We believe that principled coding is vital for quality data science practice. To effectively instill these practices within academic programs, instructors and programs need to begin establishing these practices early, to reinforce them often, and to hold themselves to a higher standard while guiding students.

Furthermore e-mail when considered in context is potentially a rich medium for the development of collective knowledge over time. It is also concluded that although distributed Lotus Notes databases can alleviate temporal and spatial complexity, this media lacks the richness required for complex processes of knowledge creation.

Empirical data is used to describe three such strat egies : 'blackboxing', 'hostage' and 'prisoner' strategies.","1995-11-01","2023-11-01 01:33:39","2023-11-01 01:33:39","2023-11-01 01:33:39","991-1019","","6","16","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Ltd","","/Users/guerrero-fj/Zotero/storage/C5VA7GSS/Scarbrough1995.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Technical Report","","","","","https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED342357","This paper explores the relationship between the concept of cognitive apprenticeship and situated cognition and the social construction of knowledge. Cognitive apprenticeship is the enculturation of students into authentic practices through authentic activity and social interaction in a way similar to that which is evident--and evidently successful--in craft apprenticeship. Knowledge is not independent, but is fundamentally ""situated,"" being in part a product of the activity, context, and culture in which it is developed. A theory of situated learning calls for learning and teaching methods which take this into account, in contrast to traditional methods which overlook the central, but restrictive, contribution made by the activities, context, and culture of schools to what is  learned there. Two examples of mathematics teaching that exhibit important features of this approach are examined.

The model describes four interpretation modes: enacting, discovering, undirected viewing, and conditioned viewing. Each mode is determined by (1) management's beliefs about the environment and (2) organizational intrusiveness. Interpretation modes are hypothesized to be associated with organizational differences in environmental scanning, equivocality reduction, strategy, and decision making.","1984","2023-11-01 01:42:28","2023-11-01 01:42:28","2023-11-01 01:42:28","284-295","","2","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","Publisher: Academy of Management","","/Users/guerrero-fj/Zotero/storage/2WDHELED/Daft and Weick - 1984 - Toward a Model of Organizations as Interpretation .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Empirical studies of information in organizations portray a pattern that is hard to rationalize in such terms. In particular, organizations systematically gather more information than they use, yet continue to ask for more. We suggest that this behavior is a consequence of some ways in which organizational settings for information use differ from those anticipated in a simple decision-theory vision. In particular, the use of information is embedded in social norms that make it highly symbolic. Some of the implications of such a pattern of information use are discussed.","1981","2023-11-01 01:45:25","2023-11-01 01:45:25","2023-11-01 01:45:25","171-186","","2","26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","Publisher: [Sage Publications, Inc., Johnson Graduate School of Management, Cornell University]","","/Users/guerrero-fj/Zotero/storage/X963H2FW/Feldman and March - 1981 - Information in Organizations as Signal and Symbol.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this article is to relate ""planning stages"" and modes of information generation with levels of environmental complexity. Propositions are developed to illustrate optimum data sets for each stage of planning, given particular environmental settings.
